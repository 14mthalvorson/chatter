# chatter

The goal of chatter is to become a device similar to Watson (IBM). Using Wikipedia articles as a database for information, chatter parses articles using the Wikipedia Python API and gathers two primary metrics: 1. a "strength of connection" between two words, or how often they appear in close proximity and 2. a list of words succeeding a given word. These two values are stored in scores.txt and links.txt respectively. initialize_scores_and_links.py initializes these two files. For functions in chatter.py, the larger these two files are (and the more information they contain) the more accurate analysis functions will be.
